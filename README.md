This add-on wraps `rsync` over SSH to sync folders between your Home Assistant instance and a remote machine. Whether you're backing up your `/config` directory offsite, pulling media files from a NAS, or keeping a warm standby in sync — if rsync can do it, this add-on can automate it.

Each folder entry in the config can push *or* pull independently, with its own rsync options. The add-on runs, syncs everything, and exits — pair it with an automation to trigger it on a schedule.

## What you'll need

- `rsync` installed on the **remote machine** (if you see `bash: rsync: command not found` in the logs, that's why)
- SSH key-based authentication set up for your user on the remote
- The remote's SSH port reachable from your HA instance

## Getting started

### 1. Add the repository

Click the badge above, or go to **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store → ⋮ → Repositories** and paste:

```text
https://github.com/braveness23/rsync
```

### 2. Install and configure

After installing, edit the configuration before starting the add-on. At minimum you need `remote_host`, `username`, and at least one folder.

### 3. Copy your public key to the remote

On first run, the add-on generates an Ed25519 key pair and saves it to the path you configured (default: `/ssl/rsync/id_rsa`). You'll find the public key at `/ssl/rsync/id_rsa.pub`. Copy it to your remote:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i /path/to/id_rsa.pub myuser@192.168.1.100
```

Or paste the contents of `id_rsa.pub` into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote. Once that's done, start the add-on and check the logs.

## Configuration

```yaml
private_key_file: /ssl/rsync/id_rsa
username: myuser
remote_host: 192.168.1.100
remote_port: 22  # optional
folders:
  - local: /config
    remote: /home/myuser/ha-backup
    direction: push

  - local: /media/music
    remote: /home/myuser/music
    direction: pull
    options: "--archive --compress"
```

### Options

| Key | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `private_key_file` | yes | `/ssl/rsync/id_rsa` | Path to SSH private key. Must be under `/ssl/`. |
| `username` | yes | — | SSH user on the remote machine. |
| `remote_host` | yes | — | IP address or hostname of the remote. |
| `remote_port` | no | `22` | SSH port on the remote. |
| `folders[].local` | yes | — | Local path on Home Assistant to sync. |
| `folders[].remote` | yes | — | Corresponding path on the remote machine. |
| `folders[].direction` | no | `push` | `push` sends local → remote. `pull` receives remote → local. |
| `folders[].options` | no | see below | Custom rsync flags, replacing the defaults entirely. |

Default rsync options when `options` is not set:

```text
--archive --recursive --compress --delete --prune-empty-dirs
```

## Running on a schedule

The add-on runs once and exits — it doesn't loop in the background. To sync automatically, trigger it from a Home Assistant automation:

```yaml
automation:
  alias: Nightly rsync backup
  trigger:
    platform: time
    at: "02:30:00"
  action:
    service: hassio.addon_start
    data:
      addon: local_rsync
```

## Volume access

The add-on can read and write the following HA directories:

| Path | Access |
| --- | --- |
| `/share` | read / write |
| `/config` | read / write |
| `/ssl` | read / write (key storage) |
| `/backup` | read only |
| `/media` | read only |

## Troubleshooting

`Permission denied (publickey)` — The public key hasn't been added to `authorized_keys` on the remote yet.

`Host key verification failed` — The remote's SSH host key changed (e.g. after a reinstall). The add-on uses `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new`, so it accepts new hosts automatically but will reject a changed key. Remove the old entry from the container's known hosts and re-run.

`bash: rsync: command not found` — rsync isn't installed on the remote machine.

One folder fails but others don't run — This was fixed in a recent update. The add-on now logs the failure and continues with remaining folders, then exits with a non-zero code at the end.
